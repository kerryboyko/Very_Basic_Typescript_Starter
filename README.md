# Very Basic Typescript Starter

This is an extremely basic Typescript starter project. All it contains is:

* Typescript
* Nodemon (for restarting when the files change)
* Jest (for testing)
* Eslint (for linting) w/Prettier (for formatting)
* Commitizen (for conventional commits)

Whatever else you want to add to it, this is a super-barebones solution designed to just get some boilerplate up and running with a hello-world to the console.
